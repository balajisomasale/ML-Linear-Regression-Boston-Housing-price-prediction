Overview of the Project:
        
        >> This project is mainly about the Prediction of house prices of Boston Dataset which is present in Kaggle Dataset or UCI Dataset or we can directly import it from Scikit learn
        
        >> I have given clear instructions by commenting in the code only, On how to use the commands to predict and split the data and how to use the libraries.
